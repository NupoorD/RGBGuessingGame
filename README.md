# RGBGuessingGame
## Introduction
The RGB colour model is an additive colour in which red, green, and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colours. The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary colours, red, green, and blue. The main purpose of the RGB colour model is for the sensing, representation, and display of images in electronic systems, such as televisions and computers. Web developers are especially familiar with RGB colour model when it comes to decorating their web pages.

This game is based on this concept.
